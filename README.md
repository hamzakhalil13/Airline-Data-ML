# Airline-Data-ML
Created and designed a model to predict airline prices and visualize airline data

We used a dataset that is derived from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that tracks airplane flights in the United States from 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. We visualize how flights have changed throughout these years, the activities of domestic flights throughout the USA, and the effect of covid 19 on air travel.
